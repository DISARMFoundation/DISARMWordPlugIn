 DISARM Plug-In for Microsoft Word on Windows desktop

The DISARM Word Plug-In supports Microsoft Word 32-bit or 64-bit running on Microsoft Windows 10.

It offers an easy way to tag or map adversary behaviors and defender mitigations in the text of a Word document to techniques and countermeasures in DISARM.
To install the Plug-In download and run the MSI file Install_Files\DISARM_Word_PlugIn.msi. This installs a macro-enabled global template into the Word STARTUP 
directory and two Excel files into the Excel XLSTART directory in your user profile. These files will be automatically loaded the next time you start Word.
The Plug-In functionality is available from the DISARM menu option in the Microsoft Word ribbon.
